# Oman Book Lovers Club - App Entry Automation

## Overview
The OBLC App Entry Automator program is designed to streamline and automate the process of entering new books into the club's app. This program makes data entry much faster and saves time.

- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Download and extract this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages by running the `setup.bat` file.

## Usage
1. Double click on the `main.pyw` file or run the program from command-line using: `python main.pyw`

2. In the application, fill in all the settings.

3. After that, click on the `Use` button in the Main Menu and fill in the details asked for there.

4. Once the program has begun running, it will enter the data of a book automatically into the OBLC website.

5. Validate the data and correct it if necessary.

6. Then press the `Add` button on the popup. This will automatically press the "Add Book" button and put a comment on the facebook post.

7. You can also press the `Skip` button which will move onto the next book without pressing the "Add Book" button or putting a comment on the facebook post, or the `Back` button which will take you to the previous book. The `Repeat` button re-enters the same book's data on the next iteration.
